This is a smartwatch which you have to buy in this great indian sale",5.0,"Pros:Look and Feel:This feels and looks very premium, and the strap quality is good for the price range. It seems pretty comfortable to wear for long hours. Display:It has a Big 1.91-inch HD display. In this price range, the AMOLED display would have been better, but the show is pretty good; it has deeper blacks, and it feels like an AMOLED display.Fitness Tracking:Most YouTubers suggested Boat brand for fitness tracking in this budget, so I have played some walking, running, and jogging. It was suitable with a budget of 1500 rs.Battery life :It has a good battery life of 340 mah battery, and it has a day battery claim for day-to-day and casual usage. If you heavily use fitness tracking and BT calling, you will get a battery life of 3 days, which is very good.Verdict :A good smartwatch with a good display and good fitness tracking in a budget of 1500 RsMy rating : 4.5/5", 5 November 2023

Good watch but bit tricky to use.",3.0,"1. Good for Bluetooth calling but very difficult to use with Bluetooth earbuds. Everytime one has to choose the speaker on phone. I wanted only a call notification on my watch and not default calling but that is not possible.2. SPo2 is not a constant feature and one has to go through the phone menu and click to get that.3. Heart rate monitoring is not always. You can set the frequency of heart rate monitoring to 5/10/15/30/60 min only.4. With regard to notifications, the available apps are Google Calender, GMail, Outlook, WhatsApp, Twitter. LinkedIn, Yahoo, YouTube only. For me that is sufficient. Infact disabled WhatsApp as it is too distracting. SMS OTP are shown on the watch and that is a good help.5. Screen brightness is very good for outdoor or indoor use.6. Watch vibrations are good for use and prompts.7. Watch faces are plenty and the collection is beautiful.8. The band and fit is a good for daily use.My take is if that take the watch with bluetooth callin feature only if you require it. Else take the non-bluetooth calling feature only.9. Faced a peculiar problem. Whenever I turned on the Always On Display, the watch's screen suddenly turned off. It was ON and very well connected to my phone but there was no display. Media playing and call were heard on the watch but I could not turn off/restart/reset it. I had to use it continuously to discharge it completely.

 Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.1) Large Curved  Display in this price category - 1.69 inch2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby  while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.2)  Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40  seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.  In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while  traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.Few  other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.2) Remote shutter button for camera.3) Call silencing option could have been added.", 12 August 2021

Good watch for all but requires improvement",4.0,"My experience with the boAt Xtend Call Plus Smart Watch has been somewhat ""ok ok,"" earning a middle-of-the-road rating. While it offers some useful features, the build quality leaves much to be desired, especially considering its price range.Starting with the positives, the 1.91"" HD display is impressive, providing clear visuals and easy navigation through multiple watch faces. The advanced BT calling is convenient, allowing me to take calls directly from the watch. The inclusion of HR and SpO2 tracking is beneficial for monitoring health metrics.However, I found the build quality of the smartwatch dial case disappointing. It is made of plastic, which gives it a cheap appearance, particularly given its price range. Many other smartwatches in the market offer metal build dial cases at a similar price point, making this aspect a notable drawback.The inclusion of ENx Tech and multiple sports modes adds versatility to the smartwatch, catering to different fitness activities. The support for English and Hindi languages is a nice touch, ensuring easy accessibility for users.In conclusion, while the boAt Xtend Call Plus Smart Watch has some useful features and a decent display, the average build quality and plastic dial case are significant downsides. For its price range, I expected a more premium feel and build material. There are other smartwatches in the market that offer better build quality and features at a similar cost. If you prioritize a sturdy and stylish design, it may be worth exploring alternative options before making a purchase.", 30 May 2023

NOt worth the money",3.0,"Review OverviewAverage2.7The Boat today launched the ‘ Boat Xtend ‘, the company’s latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs. 2,999. The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.", 17 May 2022

Good build quality & display. But not very smart.",3.0,"Skipping the parts mostly covered in other reviews and sponsored yt ones, I will add few irritants and common sense disappointments I noticed since last few days of actual usage of this NOT so smart watch:1.AOD do not show date & day of week. Only shows hour and mins. No way to configure it beyond analog/digital view. It also gets turned off when you start any exercise activity like walking. So the screen goes dark when you go for a walk!2. Calory count on home screen or anywhere else only shows step counts calories but not an aggregate calories burnt through exercise activities. I.e if step cals = 100 and cycling = 90 then it will only show 100 on home screen and separate two entries in app. Its not smart enough to do the addition.3. No quick way to go to and start the activity/exercise. First press side button twice then select activites list from menu. Versus Swipe up from home screen goes to utterly useless cricket score screen instead which many even won't use. No customisation of these menu options to functionality mapping provided.4. There is no touch to wake display available on screen. This is available on my 1800 rupee, 3 yr old huwai band 4! One has to press the side button every time just to see the home screen,which is utterly inconvenient to reach to.5. There is no day/night time auto on/off configuration of AOD or 'twist to wake' provided making it irritating during sleep hours if kept on. Thus daily two times a day its a task to enable/disable these features manually.Every freaking day!Kindly also note that there is indication, whatsoever, on AOD about the started exercise activity! So you start one, like outside walking, come home, and then after two hours discover you forgot to turn it off when you press the side button to activate the watch face screen!6. Unable to detect 20/30  mins power naps during the day time and add it to total 24 hr sleep tally. Only counts night time sleep hours that too with the average accuracy. As said before, not smart enough to do the simple math!7. Charging is fast but with even the AOD and BT calling disabled battery drains considerably in a day. Magnetic charger has its own down side e.g. gets disengaged at a minor twist tension on the charging cable.8. For activating the weather and cricket score features, user has to accept some opaque and unknown 3rd party (separate from Boat OEM opaque data privacy ones ) end user data usage policies. Without enabling GPS and/or contact/call logs access to mobile app none of these two features work. Which is very suspicious given their intended usage. Feb 23: After recent firmware update, now just to sync the data the mbl app needs gps turned on! O.w. it doesn't 'connect' to the watch over Bluetooth!9. If you remove the watch from the wrist and keep it aside, it keeps auto counting the heart rate and adds that lower count to average heart rate statistics! So to say it doesn't count the things to count and keeps counting the things not to count!10. Since installing the mobile app 'cove' I am observing rapid battery drain despite of restricting all the permissions and keeping bluetooth off. The bluetooth and sound level control functions of the phone are also randomly impaired for some unknown reasons and need phone restart to resolve.11. Sedentary remider most of the times do not get triggered when you are stationary but is notified after you start moving around!12. Cove App pushed firmware update completely wiped off all watch device setting preferences and resetting watch to all default settings, including the watch face, AOD, brightness level! The update also creepily asks to enable the gps without which it do not proceed! Now why does firmware update needs GPS??Its obvious that most of above issues/limitations can be easily fixed by software fixes and updates. But real question is do these so called dozens of smart watch chinese clone companies bother to give that much attention to details? And we know unfortunate answer to that question.", 9 August 2022

Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40  seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.  In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while  traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.Few  other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.2) Remote shutter button for camera.3) Call silencing option could have been added.", 12 August 2021

Good watch for all but requires improvement",4.0,"My experience with the boAt Xtend Call Plus Smart Watch has been somewhat ""ok ok,"" earning a middle-of-the-road rating. While it offers some useful features, the build quality leaves much to be desired, especially considering its price range.Starting with the positives, the 1.91"" HD display is impressive, providing clear visuals and easy navigation through multiple watch faces. The advanced BT calling is convenient, allowing me to take calls directly from the watch. The inclusion of HR and SpO2 tracking is beneficial for monitoring health metrics.However, I found the build quality of the smartwatch dial case disappointing. It is made of plastic, which gives it a cheap appearance, particularly given its price range. Many other smartwatches in the market offer metal build dial cases at a similar price point, making this aspect a notable drawback.The inclusion of ENx Tech and multiple sports modes adds versatility to the smartwatch, catering to different fitness activities. The support for English and Hindi languages is a nice touch, ensuring easy accessibility for users.In conclusion, while the boAt Xtend Call Plus Smart Watch has some useful features and a decent display, the average build quality and plastic dial case are significant downsides. For its price range, I expected a more premium feel and build material. There are other smartwatches in the market that offer better build quality and features at a similar cost. If you prioritize a sturdy and stylish design, it may be worth exploring alternative options before making a purchase.", 30 May 2023

NOt worth the money",3.0,"Review OverviewAverage2.7The Boat today launched the ‘ Boat Xtend ‘, the company’s latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs. 2,999. The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.", 17 May 2022

Good build quality & display. But not very smart.",3.0,"Skipping the parts mostly covered in other reviews and sponsored yt ones, I will add few irritants and common sense disappointments I noticed since last few days of actual usage of this NOT so smart watch:1.AOD do not show date & day of week. Only shows hour and mins. No way to configure it beyond analog/digital view. It also gets turned off when you start any exercise activity like walking. So the screen goes dark when you go for a walk!2. Calory count on home screen or anywhere else only shows step counts calories but not an aggregate calories burnt through exercise activities. I.e if step cals = 100 and cycling = 90 then it will only show 100 on home screen and separate two entries in app. Its not smart enough to do the addition.3. No quick way to go to and start the activity/exercise. First press side button twice then select activites list from menu. Versus Swipe up from home screen goes to utterly useless cricket score screen instead which many even won't use. No customisation of these menu options to functionality mapping provided.4. There is no touch to wake display available on screen. This is available on my 1800 rupee, 3 yr old huwai band 4! One has to press the side button every time just to see the home screen,which is utterly inconvenient to reach to.5. There is no day/night time auto on/off configuration of AOD or 'twist to wake' provided making it irritating during sleep hours if kept on. Thus daily two times a day its a task to enable/disable these features manually.Every freaking day!Kindly also note that there is indication, whatsoever, on AOD about the started exercise activity! So you start one, like outside walking, come home, and then after two hours discover you forgot to turn it off when you press the side button to activate the watch face screen!6. Unable to detect 20/30  mins power naps during the day time and add it to total 24 hr sleep tally. Only counts night time sleep hours that too with the average accuracy. As said before, not smart enough to do the simple math!7. Charging is fast but with even the AOD and BT calling disabled battery drains considerably in a day. Magnetic charger has its own down side e.g. gets disengaged at a minor twist tension on the charging cable.8. For activating the weather and cricket score features, user has to accept some opaque and unknown 3rd party (separate from Boat OEM opaque data privacy ones ) end user data usage policies. Without enabling GPS and/or contact/call logs access to mobile app none of these two features work. Which is very suspicious given their intended usage. Feb 23: After recent firmware update, now just to sync the data the mbl app needs gps turned on! O.w. it doesn't 'connect' to the watch over Bluetooth!9. If you remove the watch from the wrist and keep it aside, it keeps auto counting the heart rate and adds that lower count to average heart rate statistics! So to say it doesn't count the things to count and keeps counting the things not to count!10. Since installing the mobile app 'cove' I am observing rapid battery drain despite of restricting all the permissions and keeping bluetooth off. The bluetooth and sound level control functions of the phone are also randomly impaired for some unknown reasons and need phone restart to resolve.11. Sedentary remider most of the times do not get triggered when you are stationary but is notified after you start moving around!12. Cove App pushed firmware update completely wiped off all watch device setting preferences and resetting watch to all default settings, including the watch face, AOD, brightness level! The update also creepily asks to enable the gps without which it do not proceed! Now why does firmware update needs GPS??Its obvious that most of above issues/limitations can be easily fixed by software fixes and updates. But real question is do these so called dozens of smart watch chinese clone companies bother to give that much attention to details? And we know unfortunate answer to that question.", 9 August 2022

Everything is very good except the battery life... Ignoring the battery problem I love it",4.0,"Drawbacks•Let's know this first, which is not much...1st of all the delivery was very late, almost after 1 month of ordering this product...but I guess that may be due to the great sale offer that was going on at that time...•And second and most and the only problem with this watch is the battery life ... As mentioned in the description it will go on for 7 days, that's right and continue for more days actually but if only you use it to see the time and don't use any apps or features much...otherwise it'll hardly live for 1.5/2 days at the very beginning...BenefitsNow the main parts...•1st of all though the delivery was late, it was good and well protected...•Secondly, the featuresThis boat xtend smartwatch is really good and handy if you are a tech-savvy person... You have to download the boat wave app and connect the device through it and not through Bluetooth, you can but it's better with the app...you can set and personalize everything through this app...~Health data is almost accurate and keeps track of your well-being very well... It includes step counts from calorie burn to stress level to BP, oxygen level to even the menstruation cycle ... It gives weekly health report... breath training feature is also available if you need it...~14 kinds of sports activities including cycling, swimming, hiking, rowing, cricket etc are available there...~It has found my phone, flashlight, weather forecast, music features for phone, stopwatch, timer, alarm, and sleeping time features as well, and pretty good in using them all...it takes 1 or 2 seconds of processing time...~There are 2 types of wake-up gestures, hand free and pressing the side knob...~And if you activate Amazon Alexa then you will get to do more with this watch, like calculating easy math problems, translating your words in different languages, finding quotes, and many more...just explore and it will amaze you for sure...~also there are too many watch faces and you can also use pictures to your liking...", 10 December 2023

Good budget smart watch with Alexa",4.0,"Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.", 16 December 2021

 Got this watch just today and checked all the features one by one. Download “Boat Crest” app for pairing this.•SpO2: Measurement time is only 5-8s•Heart Rate: Takes quite some time•Live Score: Live score of a sport can be enabled from the app•Bluetooth Calling: BT works great! You can use the dialer to call manually, or sync contacts from your phone and call from the phonebook. The microphone works fine when the proximity level of your mouth and the watch is around 10-15cm; far from that, the other person might face a difficulty in hearing your voice. The speaker is very impressive as the sound in crystal clear without any echo or lag. Overall, the calling feature is a 10/10!•Steps Recorder: The step count is pretty accurate; can record 90-95 steps of the 100 you walk.•Notifications: Shows notif info upto 4-5 lines. Notifications of only Facebook, WhatsApp and E-mail can be received and no other apps. This is one demerit I found in this watch which needs to be fixed and the provision to enable notifs for as much apps as we want should be made.•Timer: Has default timers of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes respectively. Custom timer provision is also there.•Flashlight: A very bright, white background comes on the interface when you click on the flashlight option. It's definitely not as effective as a phone's flash, but works fine.•Alarm: You can set as many alarms as you want.•Weather: Don't know what's the problem but I'm unable to see the weather info on my watch. Tried pairing-unpairing, turning on and off the weather settings but nothing worked.•Battery: Got the watch with 61% battery and it's been 5-6 hours since I'm using this with 5-6 times bluetooth calling upto 15s average time per call and it's still 57%! The battery life, I must say, till now is impressive!Other features like camera control, music control are also good. Features like voice assistant and find phone are useful.Overall, this watch with such a vaste range of features in 4K is a great, and a deal worth the price. Some things like the weather info, better customisation of watch faces, more app notifs receival should be looked into and made better.I'd rate this watch 8/10 for now and will keep editing this review it I find any difficulties in the near future.", 26 August 2022

Accuracy",3.0,This watch is good at this price. It's been 25 days since I've bought it. The looks and display everything is fantastic but there's an accuracy problem which caused the deduction of stars.. for example my steps get counted even if I shake my hand vigorously.. rest everything is fine and working alright. Well the other was my own fault not to see the sports modes while buying.. it only has 14 sports modes whereas other watches at the same price or less than it provide 100+ sports modes. But for now I'm satisfied with it if I ignore the accuracy part., 6 October 2023
